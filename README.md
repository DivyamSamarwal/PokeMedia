# Pokédex
The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. 
It gives information about all Pokémon in the world that are contained in its database, although it differs in how it acquires and presents information over the different media.
